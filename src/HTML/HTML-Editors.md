# HTML Editors

HTML editors are software tools used to write, edit, and manage HTML code for creating web pages. They come in two main types: text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). Here are some popular HTML editors:

## 1. Text Editors (Simple, lightweight editors)
- **Notepad (Windows)**: Basic text editor, simple but lacks features for coding assistance.
- **TextEdit (Mac)**: Similar to Notepad but for macOS. You need to set it to plain text mode for coding.
- **Notepad++**: A free, open-source text editor with syntax highlighting, line numbering, and plugins for web development.
- **Sublime Text**: A lightweight, fast text editor with features like syntax highlighting, multi-line editing, and extensive plugin support.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful, free, and customizable code editor with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (code completion), debugging, and extension support.

## 2. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) (More feature-rich tools)
- **Adobe Dreamweaver**: A professional tool for web design and development, offering a visual editor and code view. It supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **WebStorm**: A robust IDE by JetBrains that offers great support for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.
- **Brackets**: A free, open-source IDE for web development with live preview, preprocessor support, and extension capabilities.
- **NetBeans**: A free, open-source IDE that supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages for web development.
- **Eclipse**: Known for Java development, Eclipse also supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through plugins.

## 3. Online HTML Editors (Web-based editors)
- **CodePen**: An online editor for front-end development, great for experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time.
- **JSFiddle**: Another online editor where you can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and see live results.
- **Replit**: A cloud-based IDE for building and sharing projects, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 4. Other Notable Editors
- **Atom**: A free, open-source text editor by GitHub that is customizable and supports a wide range of plugins.
- **Pinegrow**: A desktop app that lets you design and build responsive websites using visual tools and HTML/CSS code editing.

Each of these editors has its strengths, so your choice will depend on your preferences and the level of functionality you need for your HTML projects. For a beginner, Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code are great choices, while Dreamweaver and WebStorm are better for more advanced users who need a full-featured IDE.
