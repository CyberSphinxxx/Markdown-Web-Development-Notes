# HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document. They define the structure and content of a webpage. An HTML element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

## Basic Structure:

```html
<tagname>Content</tagname>
```

- `<p>`: Start tag (opening tag).
- `This is a paragraph.`: Content of the element.
- `</p>`: End tag (closing tag).

## Types of HTML Elements:

### Block-Level Elements:

- Take up the full width available and start on a new line.

### Inline Elements:

- Only take up as much width as necessary and stay within the flow of text.

### Empty (Self-Closing) Elements:

- Do not have content or closing tags.

## Nesting Elements:

Elements can be nested inside other elements. Make sure they are properly closed in the correct order.

## Key Points:

- Elements define the purpose or behavior of content on the webpage.
- They can have attributes to add additional information or functionality (e.g., `href` for links, `src` for images).
