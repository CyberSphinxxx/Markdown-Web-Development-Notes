# The HTML Skeleton

The HTML skeleton is the basic structure of an HTML document. It includes the essential tags needed to create a valid web page.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

```

## Breakdown of the Skeleton:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML5.
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element of the document. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the content (e.g., English).
- `<head>`: Contains metadata like the page title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts.
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 (supports most characters).
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Makes the page responsive on all devices.
  - `<title>Page Title</title>`: Sets the title of the web page (displayed in the browser tab).
- `<body>`: Contains all the visible content of the webpage, like text, images, and links.

You can add content like headings, paragraphs, images, or links inside the `<body>` tag to complete your webpage.
