# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create and structure web pages. It uses tags to define different parts of a page like text, images, links, and more.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key elements:
- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- **`<html>`**: The root element that contains the entire HTML document.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata and links to external files (like stylesheets).
- **`<body>`**: Contains the content of the page, such as text, images, and links.
- **`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`**: Examples of tags used for headings, paragraphs, and links.

HTML forms the foundation of every webpage and works in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).
