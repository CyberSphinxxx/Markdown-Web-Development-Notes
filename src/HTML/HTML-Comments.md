## Key Points:

- Comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`.
- Comments are ignored by browsers and donâ€™t affect the webpage's display.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This is the main heading -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <!-- This paragraph explains the site -->
    <p>This is a demo page to show how comments work in HTML.</p>

    <!-- Uncomment the line below to add a link -->
    <!-- <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a> -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Use Comments To:

- **Explain your code.**
- **Mark sections of your code** for better organization.
- **Disable parts of the code temporarily** for testing.
