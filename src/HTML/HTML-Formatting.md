# HTML Formatting

HTML formatting involves using tags to style and emphasize parts of the text, making the content more readable and visually appealing. It includes elements for bolding, italicizing, underlining, and more.

## Common Formatting Tags:

- **Bold Text**: Emphasize important content using `<b>` or `<strong>`.
- **Italic Text**: Use `<i>` or `<em>` for text that needs emphasis or differentiation.
- **Underlined Text**: Use `<u>` to underline text.
- **Strikethrough Text**: Use `<s>` for content that is no longer relevant or accurate.
- **Superscript and Subscript**: Use `<sup>` for superscripts (e.g., exponents) and `<sub>` for subscripts (e.g., chemical formulas).
- **Highlighted Text**: Use `<mark>` to draw attention to specific parts of the text.
- **Small Text**: Use `<small>` for text that should appear smaller than the surrounding text.

## Best Practices:

- Use **semantic tags** (`<strong>` and `<em>`) when emphasizing text, as they provide meaning and improve accessibility.
- Avoid **excessive use** of formatting tags, as they can clutter the page and reduce readability.
- Use **CSS** for more complex styling instead of relying solely on HTML formatting tags.

## Accessibility:

Proper use of formatting tags can enhance content structure and improve accessibility for screen readers. Always prioritize **semantic meaning** when choosing formatting tags.
